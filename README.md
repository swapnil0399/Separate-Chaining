# Separate-Chaining
This is an implementation of hashing with separate chaining. It hashes a string key into the table and store its associated value. The hash function uses horner's rule to calculate the hash value.

## Node.java

This class defines the structure of a node inside the Linked List used for separate chaining.

## LinkedList.java

This class defines the structure of the LinkedList class along with its methods. It provides operations like insert, search, delete, and clear.

## HashTable.java
This class defines the structure of HashTable class. It basically creates a table of linked lists, and provides operations like insert, search, delete, clear, printStats, and hash. The hash function provides the hash value for a given key.

## main.java
This is just the driver program for the file.

## data.txt
This file just contains the data for the driver to test the program.
